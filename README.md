# Cloud Cover

A mobile first approach to developing this weather web app in React that fetch information from a weather API using the Fetch API to populate the DOM.

## Demo

The user could input any city in the world in the search bar at the top and the DOM will display the relevant weather information.

A drop down menu provides suggestions of cities that the user could search for.

The background image will change dynamically depending on the temperature of that specific city.
